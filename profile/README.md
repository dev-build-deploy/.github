# Develop, Build & Deploy

There are many aspects to (Open Source) Software development which are not as ‚ú® shiny and exciting ‚ú®; I mean, there is nothing less exciting about ‚Äúthe next big thing‚Äù than topics such as Configuration Management, Licensing, Versioning and Release Management ü¶ó. 

I, [@Kevin-de-Jong](https://www.github.com/Kevin-de-Jong), aim to create reusable solutions to automate software engineering processes (imposed by ISO, ASPICE, and any other standard) in a way that makes this manageable instead of dreadful. 

As an Engineering Manager, having the opportunity to write solutions to my daily (enterprise) software engineering challenges is limited; I take pride in my professional learnings and applying those for all to use. As a side-benefit, this allows me to sharpen my engineering skills, ensuring that I remain relevant as a mentor and/or coach.
